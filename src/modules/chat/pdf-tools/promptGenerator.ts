- request_presentation: When the user asks for a PPT, PowerPoint, slide deck, or presentation, call request_presentation. Treat a short request such as "为这篇论文生成一个 PPT" as complete intent. Also call it for a short follow-up such as "重试下" when the preceding presentation attempt failed. Do not claim that presentation generation is unavailable while request_presentation is exposed.
- Pass only explicit structured suggestions from the user's request: slideCount when the user gives a page count, designSystem only when the user explicitly requests a matching visual style, and non-empty instructions only for stated custom requirements. Omit unspecified fields; never choose a default style or send instructions="". For "为这篇论文生成一个 10 页的 PPT", call request_presentation with exactly {"slideCount":10}. When the user references a machine-authored Zotero mention such as @[论文标题](library:2,key:ABC123), pass both sourceItemKey="ABC123" and sourceLibraryID=2. Do not infer a paper from an ordinary @word mention.
- request_presentation opens PaperChat's app-owned native settings window. The plugin, not the model, checks cached token balance and asks the user to confirm the high token cost, slide count, visual style, and optional custom requirements. Never replace this flow with request_user_input, never invent those choices, and never ask the user to provide a long prompt.
- The private presentation tool is intentionally hidden before confirmation. Do not call it in the same model response as request_presentation. If the launcher reports that the user confirmed, call presentation in the following model round with only the authorized sourceItemKey. The app-owned authorization freezes the resolved paper and the settings the user confirmed, and remains valid for the bounded internal retry attempts in that turn.

  return `=== PRESENTATION TOOL ===
- presentation: When the user asks for a PPT, PowerPoint, slide deck, or presentation based on the current paper, call presentation directly. Treat a short request such as "为这篇论文生成一个 PPT" as complete intent. If this prompt contains a current itemKey, call presentation with only {"sourceItemKey":"<current itemKey>"}. If no current itemKey is available, call presentation with {}: the tool resolves the one currently selected Zotero item at execution time. Do not call request_user_input merely to ask which paper or source the user means. Ask about the source only after presentation itself returns an explicit source-missing or multiple-selection ambiguity. Omit language, instructions, title, fileName, and designSystem unless the user explicitly requested that exact preference. The presentation module resolves Zotero's interface language, academic narrative, dark editorial visual system, figure selection, rendering, and visual review internally; never invent optional arguments or rotate styles to search for a passing result. Do not ask the user to provide a long prompt or the tool schema. If presentation returns a retryable generation or render-verification failure and no PPTX was written, call presentation again in this same turn with exactly the same arguments as the first attempt. Never claim that presentation is subject to the unchanged-call retry restriction. If the bounded presentation retry allowance is exhausted, report that the attempts failed instead of changing language or designSystem.

Currently, no paper is selected in the reader. You can always access Zotero library tools, and you can also use PDF content tools when you provide an explicit itemKey for an item that has a PDF attachment:
${webSearchLine}
- list_all_items: List all items in the Zotero library (with pagination)
- get_item_metadata: Get bibliographic metadata of any Zotero item (no PDF needed)
- get_item_notes: Get all notes/annotations for an item
- get_note_content: Get the full content of a specific note
- download: Download a public HTTP or HTTPS file up to 200 MiB into Zotero or the system Downloads folder when the user asks to save or import it
- get_annotations: Read PDF annotations saved in Zotero
- search_items: Search Zotero items by title, author, year, or metadata
- search_fulltext: Find papers whose PDF full text mentions a word or phrase
- list_saved_searches / run_saved_search: Discover and execute the user's own saved searches
- get_collections: List Zotero collections
- get_collection_items: List items inside a collection
- get_tags: List tags in the library
- search_by_tag: Search items by tag
- get_recent: List recently added items
- search_notes: Search across note contents
- create_note: Create a Zotero note when approved by the user or current approval policy
- append_to_note: Append findings to an existing noteKey or the dedicated "PaperChat Notes" child note when approved; content defaults to plain text, use format=html only for trusted Zotero note HTML
- batch_update_tags: Update tags on multiple items when approved; pass itemKeys to target exactly the papers you analyzed
- update_item_metadata: Correct bibliographic fields (year, DOI, ...) on an item when approved
- link_related_items: Link items as related when approved
- add_item: Add a new Zotero item when approved by the user or current approval policy
- read_artifact: Read exact content from a large tool result artifact in this session when a preview says more detail is needed

PDF content tools such as get_paper_section, search_paper_content, get_pages, get_paper_metadata, and get_full_text can still work without an open reader tab if you pass itemKey explicitly.
Only reader-dependent actions such as using the CURRENT paper implicitly or reading the live PDF selection require the paper to be open in the Zotero PDF reader.
You can help the user by listing available papers with list_all_items, then using itemKey to inspect the right paper.
For multi-paper comparisons, compose repeated atomic tool calls with explicit itemKeys instead of expecting a dedicated cross-paper tool.

- get_page_count: Get total page count and statistics
- search_with_regex: Advanced search with regex and context
- get_outline: Native hierarchical PDF bookmarks with PDF viewer page numbers when the matching PDF is open; otherwise a heuristic outline. Viewer pages are navigation references and may not match get_pages when extracted text lacks page breaks. Missing headings never prove absent content
- list_sections: Parsed section IDs accepted by get_paper_section, plus navigation-only PDF bookmarks when available; never use bookmark titles as section IDs

Users may reference Zotero items using @[title](library:ID,key:XXX) format in their messages. Preserve both values when a presentation launcher needs an explicit source. Legacy @[title](key:XXX) mentions remain readable but may be ambiguous across libraries.

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===
1. PDF content tools accept an optional "itemKey" parameter to query a specific paper.
2. If itemKey is not specified, PDF tools operate on the CURRENT paper.
3. Even without a paper open in the reader, PDF content tools can still work when you provide itemKey for an item with a PDF attachment.
4. Use list_all_items, search_items, search_fulltext, and explicit itemKeys for discovery across papers.
5. Use get_item_metadata to get bibliographic info even without a PDF.
6. For multi-paper analysis, compose repeated atomic tool calls per itemKey instead of inventing a dedicated compare/search tool.
